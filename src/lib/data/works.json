Premièred on 2nd August 2024, Richard Steinitz Building, University of Huddersfield.", "The theme of the programme was ‘waves’. I decided to depict the ocean’s boundlessness using waves and constant rotation to create chaos and uncertainty. I achieved this with techniques such as intervallic rotation to create continuous change, basing all pitch material off a single hexachord.", "Due to the colossal scale of the ocean, trying to represent it in an objective way would be pointless so I instead take contradictory subjective approaches; the piece is divided into two sections inspired by opposing Romantic portrayals of the ocean as violent and sensitive.", "The piece takes a human, shoreline perspective: one instrument carries a melody and the others hold pitches as an analogue for objects sporadically washing up. In the second section I use more intimate, fragile orchestration such as blending air noises and high cello harmonics. The rigid pitch material is also altered, flattening one pitch to approximate the 7th partial, resulting in a resonant and ethereal timbre."],

		"descriptions": ["In the piece I subvert the model of a chaconne, a variation on a harmonic progression, by substituting the chords with a cycle of 5 bell spectra from which I derive the pitch material and harmonic foundation. These are transcribed from the bells of Notre-Dame de Paris, in the ringing order of the grand solemnel. This reinterpretation allowed me to explore the complex hamonic qualities of bells.", "I explore different dynamic envelopes in different variations, considering the role of each instrument in the Pierrot ensemble, having studied pieces such as Vortex Temporum by Gérard Grisey. In the 2nd variation I use pointilist motoric texture inspired by Stravinsky. Towards the end, I explore the subdued, low, sustained register of the woodwind."],

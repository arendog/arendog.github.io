Written as part of Sound and Music's ***In the Making*** program for resident ensemble ***standard issue***, over a three day period. Premi√®red on 2<sup>nd</sup> August 2024, Richard Steinitz Building, University of Huddersfield.

The theme of the programme was 'waves'. I decided to depict the ocean's chaos and uncertainty with techniques such as intervallic rotation to create continuous change, basing all pitch material off a single hexachord. Due to the colossal scale of the ocean, trying to represent it in an objective way would be pointless so I instead take contradictory subjective approaches; the piece is divided into two sections inspired by opposing Romantic portrayals of the ocean as violent and sensitive.

The piece takes a human, shoreline perspective: one instrument carries a melody and the others hold pitches as an analogue for objects sporadically washing up. In the second section I use more intimate, fragile orchestration, blending air noises and high cello harmonics. The rigid pitch material is also altered, flattening one pitch to approximate the 7<sup>th</sup> partial, resulting in a resonant and ethereal timbre.
